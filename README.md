## Getting Started :rocket:

To use this terminal interface, follow these steps:

1. Either clone this repository to your local machine and run `pip install .` or install it from PyPi by running `pip install gpterminator`

2. Set the OPENAI_API_KEY env variable (you may want this in your .rc file): `export OPENAI_API_KEY=PUT_API_KEY_HERE`

3. Run the following command to start the ChatGPT terminal interface: `gpterm`

4. You can now start chatting. Type a message and press Enter to get a response.

5. Type !help for a list of commands to use

## Running with podman/docker :package:
#### Build the image and provide the `APIKEY`
```bash
podman build \ 
	--build-arg APIKEY=$(echo $OPENAI_API_KEY) \ 
	-t gpterm .
```
#### Run gpterm in the container
```bash
podman run -it --rm --name gpterm gpterm 
```
#### Set an alias for easy access
```bash
echo "alias gpterm='podman run -it --rm --name gpterm gpterm'" >> ~/.bashrc
```

## Configuration :gear:

The config.ini directory resides in different locations dependent on your OS. In order to find the path, run GPTerminator and then type `!pconf`.

GPTerminator is configurable and can support multiple configurations. Add the following to your config.ini:

   ```ini
   [CONFIG_TEMPLATE]
   ModelName = 
   SystemMessage = 
   Temperature =
   PresencePenalty = 
   FrequencyPenalty = 
   CommandInitiator = 
   SavePath = 
   ```

- **ModelName:** this is the model used when chatting
- **Temperature** = between 0 and 2
- **PresencePenalty** = between -2 and 2
- **FrequencyPenalty** = between -2 and 2
- **SystemMessage:** this is the starting system message sent to the API
- **CommandInitiator:** this can be set to change the default !<cmd> structure
- **SavePath:** this changes the location of the save path when loading/saving

_Note_: More details on some settings can be found [here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create)

After saving the config file, run: `gpterm`
Then, type !setconf and select which config you wish to use, you can also run the !pconf commang to view the current config details.

_Note_: If you change the CommandInitiator, you will now type <CommandInitiator><cmd> to execute commands...
